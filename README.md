# 👋 Hi, I’m Hakan Ural

I am a developer who focuses on building applications that are not only functional,  
but also **visually clear, user-friendly, and thoughtfully designed**.

Rather than producing purely technical solutions with generic interfaces,  
I aim to create software that combines **clean logic** with **a strong visual identity**.

## 🎓 About Me

I am a **Management and Information Systems (MIS)** student at **Istanbul University**,  
with an academic and practical interest in the intersection of **technology, usability, and design**.

My work generally centers around:
- Developing practical applications with clear structure  
- Avoiding unnecessary complexity in both logic and interface design  
- Producing small-scale, complete, and maintainable projects

## 🧩 Development Approach

- Emphasis on **clarity and maintainability** over overly complex solutions  
- Visual simplicity and consistency as part of the development process  
- Preference for **local-first** and user-focused application structures  
- Attention to both technical correctness and user experience  

I am particularly interested in interfaces that feel intuitive and engaging,  
rather than crowded or visually fatiguing.
